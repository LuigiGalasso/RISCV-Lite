# RISCV-Lite
RISCV-Lite
The purpose of this laboratory resides in the portrayal of the project of a basic pipelined RISCV-Lite
processor. After the VHDL description and a simulation through a specific assembler test code, a
refinement from RTL (Register Transfer Level) down to synthesis and physical design was performed.
The netlists obtained have been subsequently tested to confirm the correct behaviour of the processor.
Then a Special Unit was implemented and inserted in the architecture to calculate automatically
the absolute value, therefore a new instruction is added and the previous mentioned phases of test,
synthesis and Place and Route were performed. In this sense, the report elucidates the description
of the essential components needed to assemble the RISCV processor and the main choices made to
accomplish the objectives. In addition some reports were generated for both the implementation to
better compare the results.
